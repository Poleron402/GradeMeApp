# GradeMe
## A java project grading assistant ðŸ’¯

Grademe is built to help professors and TAs grade Java projects that are compiled with gradle. Support for other built tools and languages is in the works.
Grademe uses Ollama to review student code and provide insight into the quality and best practices.
This tool is not to be used on its own for grading (yet), be sure to double-check suspect results.

### Warning
The app is built with electron, so the download size is going to be higher. If you'd like to just run the script that generates html with results, pull the ```script``` branch.

**Note: when running the script, a ```submission``` folder will be generated with all the submission files sorted by student name. Make sure to delete it before running another assignment or class (only existing student names get rewritten). The submission folder is kept in case user wants to double check results, and would like to do so easily in an organized manner.**

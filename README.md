# GradeMe
## A java project grading assistant ðŸ’¯

Grademe is built to help professors and TAs grade Java projects that are compiled with gradle. Support for other built tools and languages is in the works.
Grademe uses Ollama to review student code and provide insight into the quality and best practices.
This tool is not to be used on its own for grading (yet), be sure to double-check suspect results.

### Warning
The app is built with electron, so the download size is going to be higher. If you'd like to just run the script that generates html with results, pull the ```script``` branch.

### Steps to use:
* App:
   1. Download submissions from Canvas

   3. Choose that submission folder
   4. Choose the folder that contains your __working__ project (Don't worry, it's copied as a tempfile, your project will not change)
   5. Run
* Script:
   1. Run the file with the same folder paths as arguments. E.g. ```python3 main.py '/home/project/submissions' '/home/project/assignment/'```
